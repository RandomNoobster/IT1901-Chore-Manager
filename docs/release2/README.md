# Deliverable 2
## Progress
Checkstyle was implemented, and we used the Google coding conventions from [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) as a template. We made some small changes. One change being that we doubled the indentation size from 2 to 4. The reason for this is that we are all more used to an indentation size of 4, and that we find the code to be easier to read with the larger indentation. We also increased the allowed abbreviation length from 0 to 4. This is to allow uppercase sequences like "JSON" and "UUID" in method and variable names. Again, this is because we think it improves readability and code clarity. We also changed the import order to match [RedHat's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) default setting. The regular expression that matches variable names also had to be changed in order to allow UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants.
