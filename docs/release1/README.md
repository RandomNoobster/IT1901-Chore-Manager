# Deliverable 1
## Progress
For this deliverable, we have implemented basic functionality of the application. A lot of the core logic is in place, and we have a basic UI. The UI is not very user-friendly, and the application is not very intuitive to use. We have not implemented any login functionality yet. This means there is only one temporary user object which chores are assigned to. Creating custom chores from the UI is not implemented either, but the functionality is in place in the core module. Persistency has been imlemented using the json-simple module.

### Image
The only view implemented is the main view. It currently has the following FXML strucutre:

## Work-structure
We held two weekly 2-hour meetings where we agreed on a backlog of issues to work on. The first couple of meetings included a lot of planning and initial setup of the project. In later meetings, we spent more time working on solving the issues.
